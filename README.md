## :compass: Project Status & Roadmap

**Early Alpha Software, not suitable for production**

Potential Update on Feb/2023:
* further stabilize & document the core framework
* maybe implement creative mode gameplay

This project will then be put in hibernation till (hopefully) 2024/2025. 

Please refer to [this blogpost series(chinese)]() for motivations and design overview

Forks are welcomed!

## :toolbox: Getting Started

Required Java/JDK Version: >= 17

### Run Server

Download the jar from the release page and run it
```bash
java -jar *name-of-the-jar.jar*
```

### Development

We use gradle as our build system, therefore all standard tasks should just work.

packaging:
```bash
gradle server:bootJar
```

publishing:
```bash
gradle publish
```

## :space_invader: Tech Stack

Kotlin + Spring Boot

Yes we don't use Spring Boot for game servers, but it is such a convenient way to use spring!
